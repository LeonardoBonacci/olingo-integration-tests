# odata POC


Check the branch sdl-on-jee for the final result of this POC. This (the master) branch just contains a simple implementation of the later on rejected OLingo framework.
-------------

*Disclaimer* :) 
Don't shoot the coder!!

The examples and almost all code are borrowed from the official olingo-odata repo.
It is not our goal to write beautiful code here. We just want to spot weakenesses and limitations and test potential solutions and/or workarounds.

If you, like me now, are ever confronted in life with the fact that OData is an absolute unchangeable given, remember Haruki Murakami's wise words:
> *Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.*
