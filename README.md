# olingo-integration-tests
odata POC

It's all about guru.bonacci.olingo.CarResourceIT
-------------

*Disclaimer* :) 
Don't shoot the coder!!

The examples and almost all code are borrowed from the official olingo-odata repo.
It is not our goal to write beautiful code here. We just want to spot weakenesses and limitations and test potential solutions and/or workarounds.

If you, like me now, are ever confronted in life with the fact that OData is an absolute unchangeable given, remember Haruki Murakami's wise words:
> *Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.*
